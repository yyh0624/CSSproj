	<h1>英国维斯米斯特教堂碑文</h1>
“当我年轻的时候，我梦想改变这个世界；当我成熟以后，我发现我不能够改变这个世界，我将目光缩短了些，决定只改变我的国家；当我进入暮年以后，我发现我不能够改变我们的国家，我的最后愿望仅仅是改变一下我的家庭，但是，这也不可能。当我现在躺在床上，行将就木时，我突然意识到：如果一开始我仅仅去改变我自己，然后，我可能改变我的家庭；在家人的帮助和鼓励下，我可能为国家做一些事情；然后，谁知道呢?我甚至可能改变这个世界。”
"When I was young, I dreamed of changing the world; when I became mature, I found that I could not change the world. I shortened my eyes and decided to change only my country. When I entered my twilight years, I found that I could not change our country. My last wish was to change my family, but it was impossible. When I'm lying in bed and about to die, I suddenly realize that if I only change myself at first, then I may change my family; with the help and encouragement of my family, I may do something for the country; then, who knows? I may even change the world."
